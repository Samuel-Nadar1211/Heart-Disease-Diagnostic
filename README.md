# Heart-Disease-Diagnostic
- Health is real wealth.
- In the pandemic time we all realized the brute effects of covid-19 on all irrespective of any status.
- Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, impacting millions of people annually.
- Heart disease imposes a significant economic burden due to healthcare costs and loss of productivity.
- Increasing awareness and education about heart disease is crucial for prevention and early detection.
- To analyse the health and medical data for better future preparation.

### Correlation
* resting blood pressure, serum cholestoral in mg/dl, fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl, resting electrocardiographic results have weak correlation with heart disease (0 - 0.15)
* age and sex have moderate correlation with heart disease (0.15 - 0.3)
* chest pain, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise induced angina, oldpeak, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by flourosopy, thal have good correlation with heart disease (0.3 - 0.5)
* <strong>Few Interesting Correlation</strong>
  * exercise induced angina with chest pain
  * maximum heart rate achieved with slope of the peak exercise ST segment, exercise induced angina, age
  * oldpeak with the slope of the peak exercise ST segment [very good], maximum heart rate achieved

### Observation
- Around 48.68% of people have heart disease
- Gender 0 (72.44%) tend to have more heart disease than gender 1 (42.08%)
- At around age of 41 to 50, people tend to have more heart disease (67.21%) and above age of 60 people tend to have less heart disease (40.81%)
- Type 0 chest pain mostly does not imply heart disease. Type 2 chest pain is the mostly observed in case of heart disease
- In case of heart disease, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment is mostly 2. The slope being 1 mostly implies the absence of heart disease
- In case of heart disease, generally none of major vessels are coloured by fluoroscopy
- Reversible defect in thalassemia has higher chance of heart disease
- Presence of Exercise induced angina generally implies the absence of heart disease
- In case of exercise induced angina, chest pain is mostly of type 0
- In case of heart disease maximum heart received achieved is elevated
- In case of slope of the peak exercise ST segment being 2 the maximum heart received achieved is more than slope of the peak exercise ST segment being 1
- In absence of exercise induced angina maximum heart received achieved is elevated
- Maximum heart rate achieved is less in case of chest pain type 0
- As age increases, maximum heart rate achieved decreases
- In case of heart disease oldpeak is depressed with a higher chance of being 0
- Oldpeak reduces with maximum heart rate achieved
